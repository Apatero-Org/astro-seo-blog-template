# Welcome to Your New Blog!

Congratulations on setting up your new Astro SEO Blog Template! This example post will help you understand how to create and structure your own blog posts.

## What is This Template?

This is a modern, feature-rich blog template built with Astro. It includes:

- **SEO Optimization**: Built-in best practices for search engines
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme switching
- **Multi-language Support**: Ready for internationalization
- **Fast Performance**: Lightning-fast page loads
- **Easy Customization**: Simple configuration and styling

## Creating Your First Post

Blog posts are written in MDX format, which allows you to use both Markdown and React components. Create a new file in `public/data/posts/` with the `.mdx` extension.

### Frontmatter

Every post starts with frontmatter (the section between `---` markers) that defines metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A brief description"
pubDate: "2025-01-15"
author: "Your Name"
category: "technology"
tags: ["astro", "web-development"]
image: "/blog-images/your-image.jpg"
featured: false
---
```

### Writing Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using Markdown:

- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`
- [Links](https://astro.build) with `[text](url)`
- Code blocks with triple backticks

### Code Examples

You can include syntax-highlighted code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

## Organizing Your Content

### Categories

Organize posts by category. Define categories in `public/data/categories/`.

### Tags

Add multiple tags to each post for better discoverability. Define tags in `public/data/tags/`.

### Images

Store images in `public/blog-images/` and reference them in your posts:

```markdown
![Alt text](/blog-images/your-image.jpg)
```

## Customizing Your Blog

### Site Configuration

Edit `public/data/settings/site-config.json` to customize:

- Site title and description
- Author information
- Social media links
- Navigation items
- Features (dark mode, search, RSS)
- Analytics tracking

### Styling

The template uses Tailwind CSS. Customize colors, fonts, and styles in `tailwind.config.mjs`.

### Components

Create custom components in `src/components/` and use them in your MDX posts.

## Next Steps

1. **Delete this example post** once you're ready
2. **Create your first real post** in `public/data/posts/`
3. **Customize the site config** with your information
4. **Add your branding** (logo, colors, fonts)
5. **Deploy your blog** to your favorite hosting platform
